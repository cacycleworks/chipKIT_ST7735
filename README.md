chipKIT_ST7735
==============

Port of Adafruit's GFX and ST7735 libraries to chipKIT to get their 1.8" TFT shield working on chipKIT 

Initial work by Chris K to get the code de-AVR'd and initially working on chipKIT.
Much credit to Majenko for amazing chipKIT-specific improvements as well as actual
new work in what this this particular 1.8" ST7735 TFT capabilities are! :D 
Thanks Majenko!
