### chipKIT_ST7735

Port of Adafruit's GFX and ST7735 libraries for Arduino to chipKIT to get their 1.8" TFT shield working on chipKIT boards.

Initial work by Chris K to get the code de-AVR'd and initially working on chipKIT.
Much credit to Majenko for amazing chipKIT-specific improvements as well as actual
new work in what this this particular 1.8" ST7735 TFT capabilities are! :D 
**Thanks Majenko!**

#### Install
1. Click the "Download Zip" button (usually at bottom of right column on Github project page).
2. Copy or move the `chipKIT_ST7735-master.zip` file to your mpide folder (normally Documents\mpide).
3. Extract to this folder (do not need to make 'chipKIT_ST7735-master' subfolder).
4. The folders from this project, `GFX`, `ST7735`, and `ST7735B` will then extract into your Libraries folder.
5. Start `mpide` (or must close and reopen already running mpide) and the demo examples will appear in the mpide menu File -> Examples -> ST7735 and ST7735B
